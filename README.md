# Programming Studio Project February-June 2023
Starter code for the Studio Project. This is a simple layout connected to a GitHub Classroom that serves as the basis for implementing the studio project. 

Classes backing Web pages:
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ Index.java                    - Homepages/index page. Provides a directory to all other pages
â”œâ”€â”€ Page1.java                    - Sets of 6 other Java class files backing 6 other pages.
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ Page6.java                        
```

Other Classes:
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ java/app                                - Package location for all Java files for the webserver
â”‚     Â Â   â”œâ”€â”€ App.java                      - Main Application entrypoint for Javalin
â”‚     Â Â   â””â”€â”€ JDBCConnection.java           - Example JDBC Connection class based on Studio Project Workshop content
â”œâ”€â”€ java/helper                             - Location of the helper file for loading SQLite with JDBC
â”‚     Â Â   â””â”€â”€ CTGProcessCSV.java               - Helper Java program to load SQLite database from the provided CSVs
```

Folders:
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ /src/main                    - Location of all files as required by build configuration
â”‚Â Â        â”œâ”€â”€ java               - Java Source location
â”‚Â Â        â”‚ Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ app           - Package location for all Java files for the webserver
â”‚Â Â        â”‚ Â Â  â””â”€â”€ helper        - Location of the helper file for loading SQLite with JDBC
â”‚Â Â        â””â”€â”€ resources          - Web resources (html templates / style sheets)
â”‚Â Â              â”œâ”€â”€ css          - CSS Style-sheets. Base example style sheet (common.css) provided
â”‚Â Â              â””â”€â”€ images       - Image files. Base example image (RMIT Logo) provided
â”‚Â 
â”œâ”€â”€ /target                      - build directory (DO NOT MODIFY)
â”œâ”€â”€ /database                    - The folder to store sqlite database files (*.db files), SQL script (*.sql), and other files related to the database
â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml                      - Configure Build (DO NOT MODIFY)
â””â”€â”€ README.md                    - This file ;)
```

Current Libraries:
* org.xerial.sqlite-jdbc (SQLite JDBC library)
* javalin (lightweight Java Webserver)
* thymeleaf (HTML template) - https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/usingthymeleaf.html

Libraries required as dependencies:
* By javalin
   * slf4j-simple (lightweight logging)
* By xerial/jdbc
   * sqlite-jdbc

# Building & Running the code
There are two places code can be run from
1. The **main** web server program
2. the **optional** helper program to use JDBC to load your SQLite database from the CSVs using Java

## Running the Main web server
You can run the main webserver program similar to the project workshop activities
1. Open this project within VSCode
2. Allow VSCode to read the pom.xml file
 - Allow the popups to run and "say yes" to VSCode configuring the build
 - Allow VSCode to download the required Java libraries
3. To Build & Run
 - Open the ``src/main/java/app/App.java`` source file, and select "Run" from the pop-up above the main function
4. Go to: http://localhost:7001

# DEV Container for GitHub Codespaces
The ```.devcontainer``` folder contains configuration files for GitHub Codespaces.
This ensures that when the GitHub classroom is cloned, the workspace is correctly configured for Java (V16) and with the required VSCode extensions.
This folder will not affect a *local* VSCode setup on a computer.
